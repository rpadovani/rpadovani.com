intro: "When I started contributing to the F/OSS world I was still an high-school
        student, without any incoming, and for some years I relay on support from my
        parents, so any donation was more than welcome! Luckily, my career has improved
        since then, and now I have more than enough for my own life"

So if you find my contributes valuable and want to make a donation, please direct it to
[EFF][eff], which Defend Privacy and Free Speech all around the world!

Back in 2015 I was keeping a monthly report of what I was doing - unfortunately
now my contributions are more spare, so I don't track them anymore. Still, if
you find them valuable, just drop me an email - a thanks is always welcome!
