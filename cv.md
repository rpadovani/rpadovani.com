## Experience

#### Fullstack Developer  &emsp; <small>*April 2015 - current*</small>

`Python`, `Postgresql`, `NodeJs`, `ROS`, `AMPQ`
> Archon is a company based in Italy, with offices in USA, specialized in providing automated operations with UAVs. Archon’s team members are all Italians and have a recognized expertise or advanced degrees in physics, business administration, engineering and virtual reality. The combined background of the team members is able to cover the design and management of complex drones operations.
>
> As full stack developer I'm build all the architecture of the Archon Project. We have to coordinate flght of fleet of drones controlled by an AI.
>
> I'm working on the software which interface with the AI and provides commands to each single drone (and other sensors integrated with our system).
>
> It also takes care to expose APIs to allow users to define missions and goals in a web interface built with AngularJs.
>
> We use AMPQ protocol to real time communication between the orchestrator software and all the drones: each one has a little deamon to communicate with. We created a commont protocol to work with a lot of different drones model.
>
> We're focusing on high-performance, high-availability solution.
>
> I'm involved in every day discussion on how to implement the orchestration software, which takes care of a lot of different tasks (communicate with AI, provides API for end users, communicate with drones and sensors) and I'm also involved in the development of both the frontend for users and deamons that runs on each drone.

#### Ubuntu Community Contributor  &emsp; <small>*2013 - current*</small>

`C`, `Javascript`, `Qt`, `Python`
> As developer for Ubuntu for Phones I'm contributing to build the future of mobile industry.
