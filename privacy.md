I respect your privacy :-)

This is why I do not use any third party analytics, nor I load any asset from
any other server.

But I am also a bit curios about you ;-) This is why I use [piwik][piwik], an
opensource analytics system installed on my server to analyze your behavior on
my website; I try to understand which kind of contents you like more. Privacy is
still my priority, so if you set the Do Not Track setting in your browser, I do
not track you. If you have ad blocks or privacy plugins, I do not try to
circumvent them. And of course I do not and I will not share these data with
anyone else.

If you do not want to be tracked, but you do not have the Do Not Track option,
click on this button to opt-out:

Obviously I store in my server some informations about you, like your IP address
and which page you're viewing, but these information are only used by the web
server to serve you the page.

You can find more about my server configuration [here][vps].

Also, all the connections to this website are crypted, as explained in [this
blogpost][crypt].
