I respect your privacy :-)

This is why I do not use any third party analytics, nor I load any asset from
any other server.

Obviously I store in my server some informations about your browser and your PC,
like your IP address and which page you're viewing, but these information are
only used by the web server to serve you the page.

You can find more about my server configuration [here][vps].

Also, all the connections to this website are encrypted, as explained in [this
blogpost][crypt].
