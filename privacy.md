This website respect your privacy, because it loads all of its assets from my
server, so no one (but your provider) knows you're here. Also, I don't use any
analytics system, neither DISQUS nor social buttons, so big companies have no
ways to track you here.

Obviously I store in my server some informations about you, like your IP address
and which page you're viewing, but these information are only used by the web
server to serve you the page.

You can find more about my server configuration [here][vps]
