Hello all,

this week I joined the [Mobile World Congress][0] thanks to Canonical support
which invited me. The week itself it has been awesome, but the most awesome
thing happened today: thanks to [Chimera Revo's support][1] (a big hug goes to
Simone and Luca who supported and endured me all week long) I had a talk with
Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Canonical, about Ubuntu and its future.

Here the interview:

Sorry for my bad accent :/

You can find more about Ubuntu at MWC on [Ubuntu's Twitter profile][2].

In next days I'll try write an article about the week, because it has been very
cool. Meanwhile, a big thanks to all guys I met at the Ubuntu booth - amazing
people who are working on an awesome project.

![Mark and me][3]

Bye for now,<br/>
R.
