intro: |
    I'm Riccardo. I enjoy new challenges and learning new things. I'm an incurable optimist who loves implementing tools to enable people working on their goals, and finding solutions to hard problems.

---

Currently, I'm working on building the future of finance at [Dock Financial][dock], designing and delivering a top-notch infrastructure using modern and reliable technologies.

I earned a Master's Degree in Computer Science, graduating from Technische Universität München, with a focus on Security Engineering and Language Theory.

# My daily job

As a Platform Engineer, I am focusing mainly on designing and building the infrastructure that runs [Dock Financial][dock], working closing with other teams to have fast pipelines, to quickly iterate and improve our products, and a battle-tested observability story, to know in advance any issue we could face.

Previously, I worked as Solutions Architect at [Nextbit], and as JavaScript Developer at [Fleetster], and some other roles. You can find a more precise timeline on my [Linkedin].

# Opensource contributions
 
Big part of my passion, and my knowledge, for IT related topics, is due opensource. I started contributing to Ubuntu when I was young, becoming quickly a [Ubuntu member]. I wrote different apps for Ubuntu for Phones, including [100 Balls], [Discerning Duck], and [Falldown]. 

Nowadays, the huge majority of my contributions go towards GitLab, being them code patches, issues, advocacy, or simple support on StackOverflow or the GitLab forum. Following all the contributions, I have been recognized as a [GitLab Hero]. 

# Bug bounties

<small>As RMS said, hacking means exploring the limits of what is possible, in a spirit of playful cleverness.</small>

I like breaking things to understand how they work, and _hacking_ exercises, of course, a considerable appeal on me. Among the other things, sometimes I have fun reporting security issues on different websites. You can find a report of my 2019's activity on in [this blog post][hackerone-2019]. An always up-to-date source of my activity can be found on [HackerOne].

# The rest of my life

While my online-persona is quite focused on C.S. related stuffs, I am a quite interesting person, with a funny Italian accent, enjoying life with my S.O. in Munich. I am also really private, so if you want to know me better, just drop me an email, and if you are ever in Bavaria, let's have a beer!
