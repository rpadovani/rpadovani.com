I'm Riccardo, student in Computer Science at University of Ferrara, Italy.

I'm an open source enthusiast, and in my free time I collaborate with Ubuntu
Community. I think it is a very important project to spread free software in the
world, on every type of device.

At the moment I focus mainly on Ubuntu for Phones, but I contributed to a lot
(maybe too many) different projects, with patches and bug reports.

When I'm not busy with university or Ubuntu or work, I enjoy a beer with
friends.

### My job

I work as developer at [Archon Dronistics][archon]. More information in this
[blog post][archonpost].

### Side projects

- [100 Balls][100balls]: An open-source clone for Ubuntu for Phones of 100
Balls, based on Bacon2D
- [Discerning Duck][discerningduck]: A Ubuntu scope to query DuckDuckGo
- [Falldown][falldown]: Falldown is a cartoon game where you have to tilt your phone to make ball fall down quickly with rhythmic music. Don't get squashed!

### Ubuntu contributions

It's pretty impossible (and useless) link all projects I contributed to,
so I just list projects I'm involved on daily basis at the moment.

- [Ubuntu Core Apps][coreapps]: developer, tester and early adopter (mainly
[Reminders][reminders] and [Calculator][calculator])
- [Ubuntu webbrowser][browser]: developer and tester
- [Ubuntu Italy Website][ubuntuit]: developer
