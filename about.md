I'm Riccardo, software developer. I love new challenges and learning new things.
I'm currently enrolled at Technische Universität München, studying Computer
Science with a focus on Artificial Intelligence and Data Analysis.

I’m an open source enthusiast, and in my free time I collaborate with Ubuntu
Community. I think it is a very important project to spread free software in the
world, on every kind of device.

When I’m not busy with university or Ubuntu or work, I enjoy a beer with friends.

In 160 chars: Traveler, dreamer, Springsteen's fan, freedom's fanatic. I enjoy
what's amazing in the world.
