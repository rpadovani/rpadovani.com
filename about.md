intro: "I'm Riccardo, software developer. I love new challenges and learning new things.
        I earned a Master's Degree in Computer Science graduating from Technische Universität München, with a focus on Security Engineering and Language Theory."

I’m an open source enthusiast, and in my free time I collaborate with as many
projects as I can. I think it is very important spreading free software in the
world, both due ethical and privacy-related reasons.

When I’m not busy with university or free software or work, I'm usually drinking
a beer with friends or traveling around the world.

In 160 chars: Traveler, dreamer, Springsteen's fan, freedom's fanatic. I enjoy
what's amazing in the world.
